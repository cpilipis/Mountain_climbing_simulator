# Mountain_climbing_simulator
A love 2d minimalist game about climbing mountains.
This requires [Love 2d](https://love2d.org) to run it, but not to look at the source code. Written in Lua.
=========================================

# Features

* Basic Tutorial text to learn the controls at the beginning
* Climb mountains by getting to the right of the screen
* Falling rocks you have to avoid that get bigger, faster, and more frequent as you progress
* Reset feature and stats feature for when you die
* You win the game once you get to a score of 10 (if it went on indefinetly, the rocks would quickly get too big to jump over)

# How to play

1. Install love 2d using the link provided
2. Download the game folder
3. If you are running on windows, you can download the game folder and drag it into the desktop icon for love 2d
4. If you are on Linux/Mac, navigate to the folder where the game is (probably "downloads") in the terminal and type "love MountainClimbingSimulator"

Controls: use W, A, and D keys to move.
Need a hint on how to jump over bigger rocks? Try jumping backwards when they come . . .
